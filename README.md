Salt Extensions Community Repository for Meeting Notes, Docs, etc.

## Salt Extensions working group

The Salt Extensions working group is the place to go if you would like to help
create, improve, and maintain a Salt extension. We'll collaborate as peers to
help ensure your Salt extensions well-designed and easy to use. It's a great
opportunity to network while also skilling up on Salt, Python, and module
documentation.

Come talk to the Salt documentation working group by joining the
`#salt-extensions` channel on the
[Salt Community Slack](https://saltstackcommunity.slack.com).

The current working group captains are
[Nicholas Hughes](https://github.com/nicholasmhughes) and
[Alyssa Rock](https://github.com/barbaricyawps).
